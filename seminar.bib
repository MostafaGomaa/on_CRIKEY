  TITLE={PDDL - The Planning Domain Definition Language},
  INSTITUTION={Yale Center for Computational Vision and Control,},
  NUMBER={TR-98-003},
  YEAR={1998},
  ABSTRACT={This manual describes the syntax of PDDL, the Planning Domain Definition
     Language, the problem-specification language for the AIPS-98 planning competition.
     The language has roughly the the expressiveness of Pednaultâ€™s ADL for
     propositions, and roughly the expressiveness of UMCP for actions. Our hope
     is to encourage empirical evaluation of planner performance, and development
     of standard sets of problems all in comparable notations.}
